This is one of those pandemic pet projects. 

The idea is to have a 2-way sync physical button. 

When pressed, it will mute the meeting and the LED will light up. If you now unmute using your mouse on screen, the LED will still go off. 

It involves running 2 programs - one on Arduino Leonado and one on your PC.
